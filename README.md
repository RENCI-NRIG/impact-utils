Set of utilities for ImPACT 

- [wp-dso-publish](wp_dso_publish/) - a pyforms-based utility that lets the user publish two
workflow policies (Research and Infrastructure Approval) and a dataset policy that requires
both of those are satisfied. Posts the policies to an associated SAFE server and returns 
IDs for workflows and the dataset needed by the Notary Service.
